# Noisemaker Unit Test Suite

This directory contains the PlatformIO Unit Test Suite for Noisemaker.

## Quick Start

Run all tests:
```bash
pio test
```

See [TEST_SUITE.md](TEST_SUITE.md) for complete documentation.

## Test Coverage

- **test_wav_encoding/**: 14 tests validating WAV file format generation
- **test_waveform_selector/**: 13 tests for zoom/selection math
- **test_sample_slot/**: 17 tests for BDF parsing and byte conversion
- **test_controls/**: 20 tests for button debouncing and input handling
- **test_name_generator/**: 12 tests for deterministic name generation

**Total: 76 meaningful unit tests covering 1,500+ lines of business logic**

Each test has a clear, one-sentence purpose and tests real functionality that matters.

## Why These Tests?

This suite validates the **core logic components** that don't depend on hardware:
- Audio file format generation (affects every recording)
- Waveform editing mathematics (enables user interaction)
- Sample playback calculations (prevents playback errors)
- Button input handling (ensures responsive controls)
- Sample naming (organizes recordings)
